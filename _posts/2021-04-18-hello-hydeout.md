Welcome to my website! I was learning Jekyll and I thought what better way to learn than implementing it. So I started working on a random thing and one thing led to another and we ended up here.<br><br>
Now what is this website about you may wonder? Well if truth be told even I don't know what it's gonna be I didn't have a particular aim while developing it, I was just exploring things, so we will have to watch together what it becomes. I do have a few thing in my mind which I will try to do here some of those being uploading resources of things that I learn whether through the insti or on my own, writing blogs about finance where I plan to explain things that I know about it right off from basics, it could be sort of a weekly thing if everything goes well. I will keep updating the website as and when needed. If you have any suggestions then mail them to me <a href = "mailto: s.aditya@gmail.com">here</a>. Feel free to connect with me on instagram.
