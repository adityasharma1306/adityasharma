If you hadn‚Äôt been living under a rock for the past 5 years then I am sure you must have heard about Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. These are the new buzz words but the problem is even though most people have heard about these terms, they do not understand what these words actually mean, or how blockchains actually work and what it means to mine a Bitcoin. In this series of blogs, I try to explain such things and more in a rather simplistic manner and try to filter out all the avoidable jargon to make more people aware and informed about this stuff . I will be writing around 7-8 blogs on this topic each coming out every Sunday Morning and hopefully after reading these blogs you would be more knowledgeable about Cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>So this is going to be an introductory blog about blockchain and Bitcoin, to get you started with the fundamental basics so it‚Äôs going to be a bit short but informative and by the end of this blog you would be able to answer ‚ÄúWhat exactly is Bitcoin and Blockchain?‚Äù.</p>

<p>Well the very first time anyone heard about Bitcoin was in October 2008, when a paper was released by Satoshi Nakamoto entitled,<i> ‚ÄúBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System‚Äù</i>, it was around the time of infamous 2008 wall street crash(more on that later someday) so it mostly went unnoticed but almost 13 years later it is the talk of all the market. Nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, it is just an alias, as the identity of the author of this paper is still unclear. Bitcoin was termed as a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. What that means is that no third party interference would be there in transactions made through Bitcoins like banks, government or any other institutions.</p>

<p>You may be wondering that if there is no third party involvement then who would make sure that people are paying and transactions are actually happening, who would keep a ledger or a record of all these transactions like for example if you have a kirana or a general store near your house you must have a monthly account there where you don‚Äôt pay for the things everytime instead shopkeeper keeps a book where he notes down the cost of item and at the end of month you pay for all those things at once, <b>a ledger is similar to that book where we keep the record of all those transactions.</b> In this long term relationship that you have with your kirane wale bhaiya, there is an element of trust involved, you trust him that he wouldn‚Äôt add something that you haven‚Äôt purchased and he trusts you that you would pay at the end of month but sadly the world isn‚Äôt as pure as your relationship with him, so to eliminate this factor of trust the transactions are looked by a third non-biased party which ensures that they are done properly. To eliminate this third party is a difficult task but Bitcoin managed to do that. We will now see how it did that.</p>

<p><b>Blockchain is a consensus based system used to create an append only logs</b>(in which information can only be added, previous information can‚Äôt be removed or modified). In case of Bitcoin it is this transaction ledger or record and an auditable database, which in case of Bitcoin is the amount of Bitcoins owned by a person. So who updates these? Well the answer is simple, all of the participants, and, Why would participants update it? Well because they get incentivised for doing so in the form of bitcoins. Bitcoin is essentially great because it had the ability to make people update and verify transactions by giving them something in the return. So all the participants continue to update those transactions in real time thus eliminating the need of a third party. It is important that there is only one version of a transaction ledger because to verify, participants look at ledger and if there were multiple ledgers someone evil might double spend his/her Bitcoins.</p>

<p>I guess you must be starting to appreciate what a modern marvel Bitcoin is in today‚Äôs age but you must also have a million questions like how are Bitcoins safe from hacking or what if there is an attack on the whole Bitcoin currency. Or what if someone can see my transactions and invade my privacy or how do participants update the ledger. All these questions will be answered in further blogs, there are lots of other things which are left to discuss too, like laws about Bitcoins and it‚Äôs financial impact.I tried to keep it short and in layman‚Äôs language so that it could be understood by everyone and I hope I was able to do so.</p>

<p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The first transaction by Bitcoin was made by the programmer Laszlo Hanyecz who has become well known in crypto circles after trading 10,000 bitcoins for two Papa John‚Äôs pizzas on May 22, 2010 which in today‚Äôs conversion rate equals to around 4200 crore Rupees. Before that Bitcoin was only a Blockchain technology and not a cryptocurrency. The date is now celebrated in the crypto calendar as ‚ÄúBitcoin Pizza Day.‚Äù</p>
